# Limits-of-diversification
Diversification is effective in mitigating specific or idiosyncratic risks in investors' portfolios. In other words, everything that works well is retained and non-remunerated risks in the portfolio are eliminated in order to obtain the best possible risk-adjusted portfolio.  

The truth is that diversification works well on average in all market conditions, but it does not work when it is needed most (for example, in the event of a sharp market downturn or global crisis). The only effective way to reduce systemic downside risk is hedging. The following study aims to empirically demonstrate this strong assertion and to convince on why one should not only diversify the portfolio, but also hedge (dynamically) in order to mitigate severe losses in case of black swan events.
